Assignment 10 - Continuous Integration
For this Assingment I have used Glitch to deploy my simple html and made it live.

Abut Glitch
The Glitch web application launched in the spring of 2017 as a place for people to build simple web applications using JavaScript. 
Pitched as a "view source" tool that lets users "recombine code in useful ways.", Glitch is an online IDE for JavaScript and Node.
You have access to logs, the console, and lots of internal stuff. Also, the concept of remixing so prominent in the interface makes me
much more likely to create lots of projects there, as I never have to start from a clean slate. You can start diving into the code without 
losing time setting up an environment, version control, and focus on the idea, with an automatic HTTPS URL and a CDN for the media assets.
Also, there’s no lock-in at all, it’s just Node.js (or if you don’t use server-side JavaScript, it’s just HTML, JS and CSS)
