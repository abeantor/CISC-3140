Application programming interface:
An application programming interface is a computing interface to a software component or a system, that defines how other components or
systems can use it. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that canbe made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the 
conventions to follow, etc.

API Fetching
The Fetch API is a simple interface for fetching resources. Fetch makes it easier to make web requests and handle responses than with the older XMLHttpRequest, which often requires additional logic (for example, for handling redirects). Note: Fetch supports the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
